## 👋 Hej! Hello!

Welcome to my digital playground! This is where an instrumentation engineer documents daily tinkering adventures and spectacular failure moments.

## 🔧 Day Job

**Instrumentation & Electrical Engineer** - Keeping machines running smoothly at work, then going home to make them misbehave 😅

Expert at sensors and control systems by day, professionally overcomplicating simple things by night.

## 🎨 How I Spend My Free Time

### 🍓 Raspberry Pi & ESP32 Enthusiast
My collection of RPis and ESP32s is approaching the number of socks I own. Each board carries the hope of "this time it'll definitely work" and the wisdom of "why did it burn out again?"

### 🛠️ Tool Collector
Buying tools > Using tools. Every tool in my collection is carefully selected, meticulously maintained, and then... gathers dust. But just looking at them makes me happy! ✨

### 👐 Clumsy DIY Enthusiast
My hands may not be skilled, but my heart is determined! The results might be wonky, but that's my signature design! Every piece is filled with "I really tried my best" energy 🙈

### 🪵 Woodworking Beginner
Saws, planes, chisels - got them all, mastered none. My creations have that authentic "handcrafted feel" - you know, the kind where you can tell it's handmade at first glance 😂

### 🖨️ 3D Printing Novice
Printer on standby 24/7, ready to print all sorts of "definitely useful" little parts. There's always a pile of half-finished prints with supports still attached somewhere in the house 🏗️

### 📸 Amateur Photographer
Professional camera, amateur skills. Photos come out either blurry or crooked, but occasionally I luck into a few "artistic" shots 📷✨

### 🎾 Tennis Beginner
The most enthusiastic ball-chaser on the court! Shot accuracy... well... room for improvement. But the joy of exercise has nothing to do with skill level! 💪

### 🇸🇪 Basic Swedish Speaker
Can say "Hej" and "Tack", occasionally understand the weather forecast. Dream of watching an entire Swedish series without subtitles one day 🎯
